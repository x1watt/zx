## 0.1.0

- First version: a Dart port of the LZMA SDK 26.01 (the 7zr program).
  LZMA, LZMA2 and PPMd encoders and decoders with the SDK's output; the
  x86, PPC, IA64, ARM, ARMT, ARM64, SPARC and RISCV branch filters, BCJ2,
  Delta, SWAP2, SWAP4; AES-256 and 7zAES.
- The 7z handler: reading, writing and updating archives (solid blocks,
  filter analysis, header compression and encryption, anti items), byte
  for byte the archives 7-Zip writes with the same switches.
- The xz handler (all checks, filters, multi-block and multi-stream files),
  the lzma and lzma86 handler, split volumes.
- Isolate based API: `SevenZipArchive` (list, extract, test, readFile, add,
  delete, rename) with progress and cancellation, xz and lzma file helpers,
  in memory helpers.
- Parallel xz compression in worker isolates, with the same bytes as
  `7z a -txz -mmt=N`.
- The `7z` command line tool with 7zr's commands and switches.
